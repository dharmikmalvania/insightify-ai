Nice work, Dharmik 👏
You’ve actually built **a full real-world user panel**, not just demo pages. Now let’s do two things clearly and calmly:

1️⃣ **Verify all pages & functionalities (final QA checklist)**
2️⃣ **Give you a PERFECT project presentation (college / viva / demo ready)**

I’ll keep this **structured, simple, and confident** so you can explain it without stress.

---

## ✅ PART 1: FINAL USER PANEL VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

Use this like a **tester**. Open your project and check item by item.

---

### 🔐 AUTHENTICATION FLOW (MOST IMPORTANT)

#### ✅ Register Page

* [ ] User enters **Full Name, Email, Password, Confirm Password**
* [ ] Email is validated (format + required)
* [ ] Password is hashed (bcrypt in backend)
* [ ] User saved in DB with `isVerified: false`
* [ ] OTP generated and stored (with expiry)
* [ ] User redirected to **Verify OTP page**

✔️ **Expected result:** User exists in DB but cannot login yet

---

#### ✅ Verify OTP Page

* [ ] OTP sent to **registered email**
* [ ] Correct OTP → `isVerified: true`
* [ ] Wrong / expired OTP → error shown
* [ ] After success → redirect to **Login page**

✔️ **Expected result:** User verified once, never asked again

---

#### ✅ Login Page

* [ ] Only **verified users** can login
* [ ] Wrong password → “Invalid credentials”
* [ ] Unverified user → “Please verify email”
* [ ] On success:

  * JWT token generated
  * `userInfo` saved in `localStorage`
  * Redirect to `/user/dashboard`

✔️ **Expected result:** Smooth login → dashboard

---

#### ✅ Logout

* [ ] Clears `localStorage`
* [ ] Redirects to `/login`
* [ ] Protected pages not accessible after logout

✔️ **Expected result:** Session fully closed

---

### 🧭 ROUTING & LAYOUT

* [ ] Sidebar visible on **ALL user pages**
* [ ] Sidebar does NOT duplicate
* [ ] Sidebar does NOT overlap content
* [ ] Active menu item highlighted
* [ ] Hover-expand sidebar works

✔️ **Expected result:** Clean professional layout

---

### 📊 DASHBOARD PAGE

Sections you should have (and you DO 👍):

* [ ] Total Tickets
* [ ] Open Tickets
* [ ] Closed Tickets
* [ ] Quick Actions (Raise Ticket / My Tickets)
* [ ] Recent Tickets preview
* [ ] Notifications preview

✔️ **Expected result:** User understands system at a glance

---

### 🎫 RAISE TICKET

* [ ] Title
* [ ] Category
* [ ] Priority
* [ ] Description
* [ ] Attachment (optional)
* [ ] Ticket saved in DB with:

  * status: `Open`
  * user reference
* [ ] Notification created
* [ ] Email sent to user (optional but bonus)

✔️ **Expected result:** Ticket appears in “My Tickets”

---

### 📄 MY TICKETS PAGE

* [ ] List only **current user’s tickets**
* [ ] Status badge (Open / Closed)
* [ ] Actions:

  * Edit (only if Open)
  * Close & Feedback

✔️ **Expected result:** User controls their tickets

---

### ✏️ EDIT TICKET

* [ ] Only editable when status = Open
* [ ] Pre-filled form
* [ ] Updates saved in DB
* [ ] Redirect back to My Tickets

✔️ **Expected result:** Controlled updates

---

### ⭐ FEEDBACK FLOW (IMPORTANT LOGIC)

Correct logic you implemented 👇

1. User clicks **Close & Feedback**
2. Redirect → `/user/feedback/:id`
3. User submits rating + comment
4. Ticket:

   * status → Closed
   * feedback saved
5. Redirect → Ticket History

✔️ **Expected result:** Feedback only once, after close

---

### 🕘 TICKET HISTORY

* [ ] Shows **only closed tickets**
* [ ] Feedback shown (read-only)
* [ ] View button → Ticket Detail Page
* [ ] Search / filter (category, priority)

✔️ **Expected result:** Clean history, no clutter

---

### 👤 PROFILE PAGE (ADVANCED – YOU DID WELL)

Fields that should exist:

* [ ] Full Name (editable)
* [ ] Email (read-only)
* [ ] Avatar upload & preview
* [ ] Change Password
* [ ] Notification toggle
* [ ] Last login time (read-only)
* [ ] Verification warning (if not verified)

✔️ **Expected result:** Real user account management

---

### 🔔 NOTIFICATIONS

* [ ] Ticket created
* [ ] Ticket closed
* [ ] Feedback submitted
* [ ] Can toggle email notifications

✔️ **Expected result:** User stays informed

---

## 🎯 PART 2: PERFECT PROJECT PRESENTATION (USE THIS)

You can literally **read this in viva / demo**.

---

### 📌 Project Title
